## Mock Data Structure

For initial development, use this structure for mock data:

```typescript
// Memory Item structure
interface MemoryItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  decade: string; // e.g., "1990s"
  year?: number;
  imageUrl: string;
  popularity: number; // 1-100 scale
  tags: string[];
}

// User Profile structure
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  birthYear: number;
  location: {
    country: string;
    region?: string;
  };
  joinDate: string;
  collection: {
    itemId: string;
    dateAdded: string;
    personalNote?: string;
  }[];
  following: string[]; // user IDs
  followers: string[]; // user IDs
}
```
